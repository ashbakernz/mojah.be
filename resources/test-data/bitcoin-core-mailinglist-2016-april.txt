Hello all,

Welcome to the bitcoin-core-dev mailing list.

Firstly, the idea of this list is disussion of Bitcoin Core specific
implementation concerns. 

This means, for example:

- - Proposals and discussion of e.g. a new wallet API, a P2P code refactor, etc.

- - Questions about how to implement something.

- - Questions about behavior of the code.

- - Discussion about release schedule.

Basically everything that is also acceptable on the #bitcoin-core-dev IRC channel.

But not:

- - Talk or proposals of consensus changes, soft/hard forks (use bitcoin-dev).

- - Changes to the P2P protocol (use bitcoin-dev).

- - Philosophy and economics (use bitcoin-discuss).

- - Issue and bug reports (use github).

Please behave, be civil and respectful, and try to keep things productive
and moving forward by keeping the amount of repetition to a minimum: if
something was discussed a month ago don't start a new discussion on the same
thing.

Kind regards,
Wladimir van der Laan

That's rc2, not rc1 (thanks btcdrak for noticing).
rc1 was DOA - see meeting minutes from Thursday.
Link for the tag:

The other links and downloads are correct.

Hereby I'm announcing Marco Falke as the new Testing & QA maintainer for
Bitcoin Core.

Testing and QA has always been essential to this project, and with the growing
pace of development it has become more critical than ever.

Marco has been doing a great job contributing to the project for the last year,
especially on the test framework and unit tests, increasing coverage, but also
by sanity-checking the wallet fee functionality and with reviewing other pull
requests. So it's pretty much what he's been already doing, and it's natural to
consider him for this.

He's going to oversee and merge pull requests for the QA and Testing framework,
and keep an eye on the overall quality of testing.

Welcome to the team Marco!

Regards,
Wladimir van der Laan

Thank you for the warm welcome!

I have plans to improve the test framework in the coming months (after
the switch to python3 is done). The plans include increasing overall
coverage and making the rpc test suite run faster (at least twice as
fast, hopefully), so patches can be validated quicker and we can spend
more time on the actual code.

I hope to be better reachable via my IRC handle (identical to my
GitHub handle) but if there is something I should address in a timely
manner, it is best to tag me on GitHub or send me an email.


Best,
Marco

This is a new minor version release, including the BIP9, BIP68 and BIP112
softfork, various bugfixes and updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>

Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
- --------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
- -----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.0

Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every
fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with
pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.

If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,
you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or
earlier.

Notable changes
===============

First version bits BIP9 softfork deployment
- -------------------------------------------

This release includes a soft fork deployment to enforce [BIP68][],
[BIP112][] and [BIP113][] using the [BIP9][] deployment mechanism.

The deployment sets the block version number to 0x20000001 between
midnight 1st May 2016 and midnight 1st May 2017 to signal readiness for 
deployment. The version number consists of 0x20000000 to indicate version
bits together with setting bit 0 to indicate support for this combined
deployment, shown as "csv" in the `getblockchaininfo` RPC call.

For more information about the soft forking change, please see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7648>

This specific backport pull-request can be viewed at
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7543>

[BIP9]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki
[BIP68]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki
[BIP112]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki
[BIP113]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki

BIP68 soft fork to enforce sequence locks for relative locktime
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

[BIP68][] introduces relative lock-time consensus-enforced semantics of
the sequence number field to enable a signed transaction input to remain
invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding
outpoint.

For more information about the implementation, see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7184>

BIP112 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
- --------------------------------------------------

[BIP112][] redefines the existing OP_NOP3 as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)
for a new opcode in the Bitcoin scripting system that in combination with
[BIP68][] allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based
on the age of the output being spent.

For more information about the implementation, see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524>

BIP113 locktime enforcement soft fork
- -------------------------------------

Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 previously introduced mempool-only locktime
enforcement using GetMedianTimePast(). This release seeks to
consensus enforce the rule.

Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when
they may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require
that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified
in any transaction in that block.

Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the
consensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more
than two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to
set their header times to future values in order to include locktimed
transactions which weren't supposed to be included for up to two more
hours.

The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header
time greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This
GetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with
time: it can't go backwards.

[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that
weakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future
time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()
greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.

Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for
immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.
This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,
so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will
no longer be accepted into the mempool.

**Implication for miners:** you will begin rejecting transactions that
would not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing
invalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any
transactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid
under the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed
until they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based
locktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.

**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the
current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be
rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves
forward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your
locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at
approximately the expected time.

For more information about the implementation, see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566>

Miscellaneous
- -------------

The p2p alert system is off by default. To turn on, use `-alert` with
startup configuration.
